This is the seventh part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

  1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
  3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
  4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  6. [A moving rectangle](/arcaders/arcaders-1-6/), where we draw _things_
  7. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  8. [Sprites](#), where we create shareable images
  9. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  10. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  11. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  12. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  13. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  14. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  15. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


In this article, we will put aside the game logic and learn how to use a plugin
for SDL2: [`rust-sdl2_ttf`](https://github.com/andelf/rust-sdl2_ttf). Once we're
equipped with this knowledge, we'll build an extensible, keyboard-controlled
menu for our game.

Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go!


## A brave new plugin

As always, we add dependencies by appending them to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
[dependencies]
sdl2 = "0.6"
sdl2_ttf = "0.6"
```

Once we have imported it in the `main.rs` file...

```rust
extern crate sdl2_ttf;
```

... we can initialize it in `phi/mod.rs`. The library provides two functions,
`init` and `quit`, which we must call in order to manage the resources of the
library. The thing is, if our code panics, then the end of the `spawn` function,
where we would usually put the call to `quit`, will never be reached. How to we
take care of this problem?
[RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization)!

You might remember that, even if our code were to panic, all of the destructors
would still be called. In other words, if we move the management of the plugins
into the `Phi` type, they are guaranteed to be released when our program stops.
Because `Phi` will become increasingly bigger, in part due to caching, we will
replace its instanciation by a constructor:

```rust
let mut context = Phi::new(
    Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump()),
    window.renderer().accelerated().build().unwrap());
```

And modify the type declaration as such:

```rust
/// Bundles the Phi abstractions in a single structure which
/// can be passed easily between functions.
///
/// Neither of the attributes should outlive the SDL context.
pub struct Phi<'a> {
    pub events: Events<'a>,
    pub renderer: Renderer<'a>,
}

impl<'a> Phi<'a> {
    fn new(events: Events<'a>, renderer: Renderer<'a>) -> Phi<'a> {
        // If SDL2_ttf could not be initialized, panic.
        assert!(::sdl2_ttf::init());

        Phi {
            events: events,
            renderer: renderer,
        }
    }

    pub fn output_size(&self) -> (u32, u32) {
        self.renderer.get_output_size().unwrap()
    }
}

impl<'a> Drop for Phi<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        ::sdl2_ttf::quit();
    }
}
```

Notice how the `new` method was _not_ made public. This is because it shouldn't
be available outside of the library's internals, otherwise anyone could call it
and initialize/terminate the libraries that Phi depends on at will.

Now that `sdl2_ttf` is initialized, it is time to _use_ it. Let us create a new
file, `src/views/menu.rs`, which will become our _testing facility_ for the time
being. For the moment we will simply show the number of seconds elapsed since we
showed the menu view:

```rust
// views/menu.rs

use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::phi::data::Rectangle;
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;
use ::sdl2::render::TextureQuery;
use ::std::path::Path;


pub struct MenuView {
    /// The total time elapsed in the view since its creation
    elapsed_total: f64,

    /// The font used to draw the total elapsed time
    font: ::sdl2_ttf::Font,
}

impl MenuView {
    pub fn new(phi: &mut Phi) -> MenuView {
        // Font::from_file takes in a path and the size of the font, and returns
        // a Result<Font, String>. We unwrap the value, so that if the file does
        // not exist, we panic, and otherwise continue as usual.
        let font = ::sdl2_ttf::Font::from_file(Path::new("assets/belligerent.ttf"), 32).unwrap();

        MenuView {
            elapsed_total: 0.0,
            font: font,
        }
    }
}

impl View for MenuView {
    fn render(&mut self, phi: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction {
        self.elapsed_total += elapsed;

        let events = &phi.events;

        if events.now.quit || events.now.key_escape == Some(true) {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }

        phi.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        phi.renderer.clear();

        // We generate a String representing the time
        // By switching to i32, we trim off the decimals and keep only the
        // integer part of the number.
        let elapsed_string = format!("{}", self.elapsed_total as i32);

        // Implicitly, &String -> &str; similarly, &Vec<T> -> &[T]
        let elapsed_str = &elapsed_string;

        // render_str_blender(text, color) -> Result<Surface, String>
        let surface = self.font.render_str_blended(&elapsed_str, Color::RGB(255, 255, 255)).unwrap();

        // However, we cannot directly render a Surface; we must first transform
        // it into a Texture.
        let texture = phi.renderer.create_texture_from_surface(&surface).unwrap();

        // It is through TextureQuery that we query information about textures.
        // Seems legit!
        let TextureQuery { width: w, height: h, .. } = texture.query();
        let w = w as f64;
        let h = h as f64;

        // `copy` is the method through which we can render a Texture.
        // fn copy(&Texture, Option<SdlRect>, Option<SdlRect>)
        phi.renderer.copy(&texture,
            None,
            Rectangle { w: w, h: h, x: 32.0, y: 32.0 }.to_sdl());

        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

```rust
// views/mod.rs
// ...

pub mod menu;

// ...
```

```rust
// main.rs
// ...

::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |phi| {
    Box::new(::views::menu::MenuView::new(phi))
});

// ..
```

If you run this program, you should get something like this:

![A window showing an incrementing number](/images/arcade-7.png)

That was a lot of code to get such a simple result, and we'll fix this soon
enough. For the moment, however, I want to explain a few lines.

```rust
let elapsed_str = &elapsed_string;
```

As specified in the comments, the way you generate a string slice (`&str`) from
a `String` is by taking a reference to it. It's that easy. It works because
`String` implements the `Borrow` trait, which allows to alter the behaviour of
the `&` operator:

```rust
pub trait Borrow<Borrowed> where Borrowed: ?Sized {
    fn borrow(&self) -> &Borrowed;
}

impl Borrow<str> for String {
    fn borrow(&self) -> &str { ... }
}
```

If you recall our discussion on trait objects, you should notice that `Borrowed`
does not need to implement `Sized`; that is, we may put a trait in its place!

Behind the scenes, the compiler will find how `elapsed_str` is being used (in
this case, as an argument to `render_str_blended`) and, if a `&str` is expected,
it will call `borrow()` and transform the reference into a string slice. It's
basically type inference on steroids.

`&Vec<T>` acts in a similar way, pretending to be a _slice_ `&[T]` whenever
necessary.

```rust
let w = w as f64;
let h = h as f64;
```

This is called _shadowing_. We do _not_ modify the original binding to `w`, but
create a new one and, from that point on, pretend that its predecessor never
existed. It's a technique often used in functional languages, when multiple
steps are necessary to produce a value, but we do not want to end up with 20
unnecessary variables polluting the local scope.

It is to be noted that the old binding _is not actually destroyed_, just hidden.
That way, references to it will still be valid, even after the shadowing
occurred.

```rust
phi.renderer.copy(&texture,
    None,
    Rectangle { w: w, h: h, x: 32.0, y: 32.0 }.to_sdl());
```

`Renderer::copy` blits (copies the pixels of) a texture onto the buffer used by
the renderer. The second arguments (`None`) describes the _region_ of the image
which we intend to copy; `None` means that we want the whole image, and `Some`
expects an `SdlRect` representing said region (with every value in pixels).

The third argument is similar to the second, except that it describes the part
of the window to which we want to copy the texture &mdash; the renderer would
then automatically resize the blitted region to fit.

Now, this is good and all, but it seems like a _lot_ of work for such a simple
thing; surely, there's a way to abstract this process! Moreover, fonts are like
_the_ thing that people use throughout their program, so it would be nice if we
could care them and store them in an object that is shared by all of the views.

Wait... an object shared by all of the views.


## A library concern!

We will now modify `Phi` in two ways. First, we shall cache the fonts used by
the user; then, we will move the texture-making logic to a new method. Through
this process, we will learn about error propagation (using `try!`), __TODO__

Open `phi/mod.rs` and let's begin by importing the `HashMap` collection:

```rust
use ::std::collections::HashMap;
```

Then, we can add the private `fonts` attribute to the `Phi` type declaration:

```rust
pub struct Phi<'p, 'r> {
    pub events: Events<'p>,
    pub renderer: Renderer<'r>,

    fonts: HashMap<(&'static str, i32), sdl2_ttf::Font>,
}
```
