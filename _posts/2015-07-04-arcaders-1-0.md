This is the introduction of a tutorial series whose objective is to explore
the Rust programming language through the development of a simple, old-school
shooter. It is composed of 15 parts, excluding this introduction:


  1. [A simple window](#), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](#), where we handle events (duh!)
  3. [Views](#), where we discover the principal abstraction we will use throughout our program
  4. [Switching views](#), where we learn about pointers, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [A moving rectangle](#), where we draw _things_
  6. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  7. [Sprites](#), where we create shareable images
  8. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  9. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  10. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  11. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  12. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  13. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  14. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  15. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


This tutorial was written for people who are already somewhat familiar to the
craft of software development, perhaps even through a scripting language, and
who have just discovered this strange beast called _Rust_. They skimmed through
the [Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), read plenty of blog posts about
how this familiar-looking language supposedly challenges all previous ideas
about software safety and, excited, want to discover how Rust _really works out_
in practice.

In the next couple of weeks, we are going to build a simple space shooter based
on Mike Geig's superb [2D Game Development Course](http://fixbyproximity.com/2d-game-development-course/),
and a basic library called _phi_ which will provide us with the basic components
required by 2D games, such as _views_ (called _screens_ by LibGDX), _rectangles_
with built-in (albeit basic) collision detection, and _animated sprites_.

The library we are going to use for that will be AngryLawyer's SDL2 bindings,
version 0.5, which you can see [here](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2),
and the associated plugins.

Before we continue, I want to stress that you do not need to have mastered Rust
prior to reading this tutorial. On the contrary, exploring Rust's subtleties is
one of the objectives, if not the main one because, let's be honest, I do not
recommend to use _phi_ in production.

So, without further do, [let's get to it](#)!
