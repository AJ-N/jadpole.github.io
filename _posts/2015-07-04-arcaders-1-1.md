This is the first part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/2015/185/arcaders-1-0):

  1. [A simple window](/2015/185/arcaders-1-1), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](/2015/187/arcaders-1-2), where we discuss lifetimes
  3. [More event handling](/2015/187/arcaders-1-3), where we discuss macros
  4. [Views](/2015/188/arcaders-1-4), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [Switching views](#), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  6. [A moving rectangle](#), where we draw _things_
  7. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  8. [Sprites](#), where we create shareable images
  9. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  10. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  11. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  12. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  13. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  14. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  15. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


## A brave new project

Let us begin by kindly asking Cargo to create a new project for us. In your
projects' directory, run:

    $ cargo new arcade-rs --name arcade-rs --bin
    $ cd arcade-rs

If you open the generated `Cargo.toml`, you should see something similar to the
following:

    [package]
    name = "arcade-rs"
    version = "0.1.0"
    authors = ["John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"]

You can `cargo run` the generated hello world program, but this is of little
value to us right now. What we _will_ do, however, is change slightly this
configuration file in order to include our dependencies. You should add the
following lines at the end of the file:

    [dependencies]
    sdl2 = "0.5"

Towards the end, our project will depend on _way_ more external _crates_
(Rust's concept of a library), but this is all we need for the moment. The
`sdl2` crate will allow us to create a window, render to it, and handle
events... and it so happens that this is exactly what we are going to do in
this article and the next.

Now that SDL2 is (hopefully) correctly installed on your system, you can execute:

    $ cargo build
        Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
       Compiling sdl2-sys v0.5.0
       Compiling bitflags v0.2.1
       Compiling libc v0.1.8
       Compiling rustc-serialize v0.3.15
       Compiling rand v0.3.8
       Compiling num v0.1.25
       Compiling sdl2 v0.5.0
       Compiling arcade-rs v0.1.0 (file:///home/ayden/Projects/arcade-rs)

If all goes well, the bindings and their dependencies have been compiled and we
are ready to open a window. Otherwise, SDL2 was probably incorrectly installed
and you need to get that out of the way before moving on.


## Three seconds of awesome

Alright, let there be a window! Open `src/main.rs` in your favourite editor and
change the content for this one:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;

use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    let sdl_context = sdl2::init().video()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    // Create the window
    let window = sdl_context.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
    renderer.clear();
    renderer.present();
    
    thread::sleep_ms(3000);
}
```

Now, when you run the program...

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling arcade-rs v0.1.0 (file:///home/ayden/Projects/arcade-rs)
     Running `target/debug/arcade-rs`
```

![Our first window](/images/arcade-1.png)

... you should see a window appearing on your screen for 3 seconds, then
automatically disappearing. And that was it! Now for the fun part: actually
understanding what we just wrote.

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
```

We begin by including the `sdl2` _crate_ that we just added to our dependencies.
If we wanted, we could have given it another name _Ã -la python_. For example:

```rust
extern crate sdl2 as pineapple;
```

We would then replace every occurence of `sdl2` by `pineapple` and the result
would be the same. However, as much as I like pineapples, I'll continue with
`sdl2` for the rest of this series (although nothing stops _you_ from doing so).
A similar syntax can be used for renaming `use`d types and functions: this one
I _will_ make use of in the [sixth article](#).

```rust
use sdl2::pixels::Color;
use std::thread;
```

The first line simply means: `::sdl2::pixels::Color` is way too long for me to
type, so let me `use` only the last name of this path instead, that is `Color`,
to represent the same _thing_. Not only does `use` statements work with types
and functions, they also work with modules. This is, in fact, the job of the
second line: instead of writing `std::thread::whatever()`, we may now write
`thread::whatever()`.

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

Here, we simply declare the `main` function, which is acting as the entry point
for our program.

```rust
    let sdl_context = sdl2::init().video()
        .build().unwrap();
```

Now, it starts to be interesting! The function `init()` returns an object which
we will use to initialize the SDL2 context. What's great is that it uses Rust's
variation of what is called the _builder pattern_. That is, `init()` returns an
object of type...

```rust
pub struct InitBuilder {
    flags: u32
}
```

... which provides a convenient interface to the SDL2 API. By calling methods
such as `timer()`, `joystick()`, and `video()`, we can choose which _parts_ of
SDL2 we will utilize, minimizing the library's footprint. Once we're ready, we
call the `build()` method, which returns a `Result<Sdl, String>`.

The type system _forces_ us to deal with the possibility of getting an error
when we want to get the returned value. In this case, we simply `unwrap()` the
value, which means that we print the error message and panic, _safely crashing_
the program, if the result is an `Err(String)`, and that we assign the context
to `sdl_context` if the result is of type `Ok(Sdl)`.

The nice thing about binding the context to an identifier is that, once it goes
out of scope (at the end of the main method), all of the resources owned by the
SDL library will be automatically freed. In fact, even if we panic at some
point in the program, the destructor will still be called as usual, preventing
memory leaks. This is what I mean by _safely crashing_.

```rust
    let window = sdl_context.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();
```

This is where we open the window. It has a title of "ArcadeRS Shooter", a width
of 800 pixels, and a height of 600 pixels. As before, it uses the builder
pattern, which allows us to simply center the window in the screen and activate
OpenGL (faster) rendering.

```rust
    let mut renderer = window.renderer()
        .accelerated()
        .build().unwrap();
```

You know the drill! We are creating a renderer, which we will later use to
_draw things_, associated with the window and setting it up so that it uses
OpenGL to ease the rendering process. If it cannot be created, the program
panics with an error message.

```rust
    renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
    renderer.clear();
    renderer.present();
```

On the first line, we set the _brush_ color to black (red=0, green=0, blue=0).
On the second one, we clear the content of the buffer and fill it with the
previously chosen _brush_ color. The third line swaps the buffers and actually
_shows_ what we have drawn to the user.

If we take this line off, weirdness happen. In Gnome, for example, the content
of the window is set to whathever was previously behind it. However, as is
tradition in the Rust world, it will _look weird_, but the `renderer` provides
an interface from which we cannot crash the program.

![A window not ``present`ed](/images/arcade-2.png)

```rust
    thread::sleep_ms(3000);
```

Here, we simply _wait_ 3000 milliseconds, or 3 seconds, before moving on. And
it turns out that afterwards, `main` finishes and all the resources that were
allocated inside it are freed. To our user, it simply results in the window
closing. To us, it's not very different. And if a lot is happening here, the
nice thing is that we do not have to worry about it!

What you might have noticed is that we never had to write down a single type.
Sure, we used module functions and associated functions (which you might know
better under the name _static methods_), such as `sdl2::init` and `Color::new`,
but we never had to tell Rust that our context was of type `sdl2::Sdl`. This is
called _type inference_ and it's one of these numerous features that, although
they seem like minor additions, make Rust a pleasure to work with.

That was all for the first part of this series. [Next time](/arcaders/2015/07/06/arcaders-1-2),
we will come up with a better way to close our window: by clicking on the `x`.

Until then, keep rusting!
