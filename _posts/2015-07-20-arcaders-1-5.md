This is the fifth part of a series whose objective is to explore the Rust
programming language through the development of a simple, old-school shooter.
It is composed of 16 parts, excluding the [introduction](/arcaders/arcaders-1-0/):

  1. [A simple window](/arcaders/arcaders-1-1/), where we install SDL2
  2. [Event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-2/), where we discuss lifetimes
  3. [More event handling](/arcaders/arcaders-1-3/), where we discuss macros
  4. [Views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-4/), where we learn about boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  5. [Switching views](/arcaders/arcaders-1-5/), where we use boxes, pattern matching, trait objects, and dynamic dispatch
  6. [A moving rectangle](#), where we draw _things_
  7. [Main menu](#), where we play with textures and Rust's vectors
  8. [Sprites](#), where we create shareable images
  9. [Backgrounds](#), where we handle resizing, scale and translate through time
  10. [The player's ship](#), where we control a multi-sprite object
  11. [Shooting bullets](#), where we handle resource pooling
  12. [Animated sprites](#), where we render animated asteroids
  13. [Asteroid attack!](#), where we make multiple objects interact
  14. [Explosions](#), where we see things do _boom_.
  15. [Music](#), where we hear things go _boom_.
  16. [High score & wrap-up](#), where we play with the filesystem


In the last article, I left you with an idea: storing the current view of our
application in a `Box<View>`, so that we could change our view and its type at
runtime. To get the same behaviour as we have now, our code would have the
following structure:

1. Initialize SDL and create our `context` variable (of type `Phi`)
2. Assign the first view to a `current_view` binding of type `Box<View>`
3. Loop:
    1. Pump the inputs
    2. Call `current_view.render`
        1. Quit accordingly with the events
        2. Render the content
    3. Match against the result: `None => {swap the buffers}`, `Quit => {close the game}`

For the moment, you can simply pass a constant `elapsed` time to `View#render`;
`0.01` seconds should do the trick.

In this case, we move the event handling (and window closing) logic to our
default view. Or, rather, _you_ do. It's not too hard, but one must think about
it for a few minutes. Once you're finished, you can scroll down and look at my
answer. Good luck!


## Viewify all the things

The first step is to declare our default view. It is now time to put _stuff_ in
`src/views/mod.rs`:

```rust
use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;

pub struct DefaultView;

impl View for DefaultView {
    fn resume(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn pause(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn render(&mut self, context: &mut Phi, _: f64) -> ViewAction {
        let renderer = &mut context.renderer;
        let events = &context.events;
    
        if events.now.quit || Some(true) == events.now.key_escape {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }
        
        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 0));
        renderer.clear();
        
        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

You might notice the `_` in the parameters of the different methods. Like in
patterns, the underscore stands for _I do not care about this value_.

It is now time to take care of our `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate sdl2;
mod phi;
mod views;

use ::phi::{Events, ViewAction};

// We import the `timer` module, which we will use shortly.
use ::sdl2::timer;

fn main() {
    // Initialize SDL2
    // Notice how we also initialized the `timer` component of SDL!
    let mut sdl_context = sdl2::init().timer().video()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let window = sdl_context.window("ArcadeRS Shooter", 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    // Create the context
    let mut context = ::phi::Phi {
        events: Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump()),
        renderer: window.renderer()
            .accelerated()
            .build().unwrap(),
    };
    
    // Create and show the default view
    let mut current_view: Box<::phi::View> = Box::new(::views::DefaultView);
    current_view.resume(&mut context);
    
    // [TODO]: Insert frame timing here
    
    loop {
        context.events.pump();
        
        match current_view.render(&mut context, 0.01f64) {
            ViewAction::None => context.renderer.present(),
            ViewAction::Quit => {
                current_view.pause(&mut context);
                break;
            },
        }
    }
}
```

If you tried it by yourself, you should have reached a similar result. If you
run the program, you should get exactly the same thing as before, except that
our code is now much more modular, which will eventually allow us to change our
current view at runtime. For the moment, however, I would like to handle
_frame timing_. Our objective is to diminish the frame count to ~60fps, and to
count and print the frames per second.

So, let's introduce a new module provided by `rust-sdl2`: `sdl2::timer`, which
provides functions for dealing with time. We will use two of them: `get_ticks`,
which allows us to get the time in milliseconds since the program has started,
and `delay`, which allows to wait a certain number of milliseconds. We use
`get_ticks` to give more information to `View`'s `render` method; `delay`, on
the other hand, is used to give back CPU cycles to the operating system, so
that our user's computer doesn't slow down because of an... old-school shooter.
That would be awkward.

You should change the code under `current_view.resume` to:

```rust
// Frame timing

let interval = 1_000 / 60;
let mut before = timer::get_ticks();
let mut last_second = timer::get_ticks();
let mut fps = 0u16;

loop {
    // Frame timing (bis)
    
    let now = timer::get_ticks();
    let dt = now - before;
    let elapsed = dt as f64 / 1_000.0;
    
    // If the time elapsed since the last frame is too small, wait out the
    // difference and try again.
    if dt < interval {
        timer::delay(interval - dt);
        continue;
    }
    
    before = now;
    fps += 1;
    
    if now - last_second > 1_000 {
        println!("FPS: {}", fps);
        last_second = now;
        fps = 0;
    }
    
    
    // Logic & rendering

    context.events.pump();
    
    match current_view.render(&mut context, elapsed) {
        ViewAction::None => context.renderer.present(),
        ViewAction::Quit => {
            current_view.pause(&mut context);
            break;
        },
    }
}
```

On my system, I get a constant 63fps, and you should get something similar.
If you wanted to get a steady 60fps, you could increase the precision of the
time (for example, by using microseconds instead). I leave it as an exercise.
Now, to change the view!


## Abstracting the game loop

It is now time to move the main loop to `src/phi/mod.rs` and to remove the burden
of a _default view_. To do so, let us now discover another _functional_ feature
of the Rust programming language: closures.

Firstly, we shall clear the `main` function and declare a new one called
`spawn` in `src/phi/mod.rs`. Here's the code:

```rust
// src/main.rs

extern crate sdl2;
mod phi;
mod views;

fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |_| {
        Box::new(::views::DefaultView)
    });
}
```

```rust
// src/phi/mod.rs

// Add somewhere in the top of the file...
use ::sdl2::timer;

// <previous content>

/// Create a window with name `title`, initialize the
/// underlying libraries and start the game with the `View`
/// returned by `init()`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here, we simply show a window with color #ffff00 and exit
/// when escape is pressed or when the window is closed.
///
/// ```
/// struct MyView;
/// 
/// impl View for MyView {
///     fn resume(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {}
///     fn pause(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {}
///     fn render(&mut self, context: &mut Phi, _: f64) -> ViewAction {
///         if context.events.now.quit {
///             return ViewAction::Quit;
///         }
///         
///         context.renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(255, 255, 0));
///         context.renderer.clear();
///         ViewAction::None
///     }
/// }
///
/// spawn("Example", |_| {
///     Box::new(MyView)
/// });
/// ```
pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
    // Initialize SDL2
    
    let mut sdl_context = ::sdl2::init().timer().video()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let window = sdl_context.window(title, 800, 600)
        .position_centered().opengl()
        .build().unwrap();
    
    let mut context = Phi {
        events: Events::new(sdl_context.event_pump()),
        renderer: window.renderer()
            .accelerated()
            .build().unwrap(),
    };
    
    // Create and show the default view
    
    let mut current_view = init(&mut context);
    current_view.resume(&mut context);
    
    // Frame timing
    
    let interval = 1_000 / 60;
    let mut before = timer::get_ticks();
    let mut last_second = timer::get_ticks();
    let mut fps = 0u16;
    
    loop {
        // Frame timing (bis)
        
        let now = timer::get_ticks();
        let dt = now - before;
        let elapsed = dt as f64 / 1_000.0;
        
        if dt < interval {
            timer::delay(interval - dt);
            continue;
        }
        
        before = now;
        fps += 1;
        
        if now - last_second > 1_000 {
            println!("FPS: {}", fps);
            last_second = now;
            fps = 0;
        }
        
        
        // Logic & rendering
    
        context.events.pump();
        
        match current_view.render(&mut context, elapsed) {
            ViewAction::None => context.renderer.present(),
            ViewAction::Quit => {
                current_view.pause(&mut context);
                break;
            },
        }
    }
}
```

In `src/phi/mod.rs`, only three lines matter to us. Those are:

```rust
pub fn spawn<F>(title: &str, init: F)
where F: Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View> {
```

and

```rust
let mut current_view = init(&mut context);
```

In the first two, we say that `init` must be of type `F`, which implements the
`Fn(&mut Phi) -> Box<View>` trait. But why a trait? This is because `Fn` does
not describe the signature of a _function_; it describes that of a _closure_.
A function is a closure, but a closure is not a function. It has something
more. It can _capture_ its environment, and borrow values from its outer scope.

Say you have the following code:

```rust
let x = 3i32;
let f = |y| x + y;
let y = f(4);
```

Here, `y` has value 7. But how can it be? Well, closures are syntactic sugar
for something _way_ more complex. Manually, you would rewrite this code as:

```rust
struct F<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> F<'a> {
    fn call(&self, y: i32) -> i32 {
        *self.x + y
    }
}

let x = 3;
let f = F {
    x: &x
};

let y = f.call(4);
```

It is to be noted that we did not have to write down the closure's type in the
first excerpt, because... type inference. Gotta love it! You could write down
the type explicitly using the usual convention:

```rust
let f = |y: i32| -> i32 { x + y };
```

Thus, Rust automatically generates a struct for every closure, or simply passes
a reference to a normal function if the closure doesn't borrow any value. So,
_spawn_ works like any statically dispatched generic function, except for the
fact that it uses closure types instead of _normal_ types.

Then, in the third line, we simply _call_ the closure with a mutable reference
to the context as an argument.

In `main.rs`, similarly, three lines matter to us. Those are:

```rust
::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |_| {
    Box::new(::views::DefaultView)
});
```

Here, we call `::phi::spawn()` with the requested arguments: a string slice
representing the title of our window and a closure accepting the borrowed
context, which we simply _ignore_ because we do not need it in our view's
construction.

Now that this is out of the way, it is time to actually _change the current view_.


## Changing views

Now that everything is in place, changing the current view is pretty
straightforward. The first step is to add a new field to `ViewAction`:

```rust
pub enum ViewAction {
    None,
    Quit,
    ChangeView(Box<View>),
}
```

Next, we take it in accout when matching the result of the render:

```rust
match current_view.render(&mut context, elapsed) {
    ViewAction::None => context.renderer.present(),
    ViewAction::Quit => {
        current_view.pause(&mut context);
        break;
    },
    ViewAction::ChangeView(new_view) => {
        current_view.pause(&mut context);
        current_view = new_view;
        current_view.resume(&mut context);
    }
}
```

If you compile and run the program, you should get a warning:

```
warning: variant is never used: `ChangeView`, #[warn(dead_code)] on by default
```

We're going to fix that right now. To do that, we will handle another event:
the space bar.

```rust
struct_events!(
    keyboard: {
        key_escape: Escape,
        key_up: Up,
        key_down: Down,
        key_space: Space
    },
    else: {
        quit: Quit { .. }
    }
);
```

The following program will have two views, `ViewA` and `ViewB`. In either,
pressing the spacebar will cause the next one to be shown instead. Also, while
`ViewA` will be filled with red, `ViewB` will be entirely blue. This part isn't
too hard, and so you should do it by yourself, and then look at my solution.

...

You're done? Well, here's my version:

```rust
// src/main.rs

extern crate sdl2;
mod phi;
mod views;

fn main() {
    ::phi::spawn("ArcadeRS Shooter", |_| {
        Box::new(::views::ViewA)
    });
}
```

```rust
// src/views/mod.rs

use ::phi::{Phi, View, ViewAction};
use ::sdl2::pixels::Color;

pub struct ViewA;

impl View for ViewA {
    fn resume(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn pause(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn render(&mut self, context: &mut Phi, _: f64) -> ViewAction {
        let renderer = &mut context.renderer;
        let events = &context.events;
    
        if events.now.quit || Some(true) == events.now.key_escape {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }
        
        if Some(true) == events.now.key_space {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(ViewB));
        }
        
        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(255, 0, 0));
        renderer.clear();
        
        ViewAction::None
    }
}


pub struct ViewB;

impl View for ViewB {
    fn resume(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn pause(&mut self, _: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn render(&mut self, context: &mut Phi, _: f64) -> ViewAction {
        let renderer = &mut context.renderer;
        let events = &context.events;
    
        if events.now.quit || Some(true) == events.now.key_escape {
            return ViewAction::Quit;
        }
        
        if Some(true) == events.now.key_space {
            return ViewAction::ChangeView(Box::new(ViewA));
        }
        
        renderer.set_draw_color(Color::RGB(0, 0, 255));
        renderer.clear();
        
        ViewAction::None
    }
}
```

Pretty simple, isn't it? Now, you might be slightly bothered by the amount of
code we have to repeat. However, once we start building our game's logic, the
repeated portions will become less apparent, and the flexibility given by this
model will be much more important.

The main advantage of this approach is that the game loop is now a library
concern. It is abstracted away in such a way that one could decide to implement
it differently for different devices... or eventually for the Web (by using
`requestAnimationFrame` behind the scenes). Although this option is not yet
available/stable, we are future-proofing our code while making it reusable by
other projects we might undertake in the future.

One thing that we will fix right now is the necessity to implement `pause` and
`resume`. Those are nice abstractions, however most of the time, we will not
need these, as resource management will be handled while constructing the
views. And as having them in the way doesn't serve much purpose, we can provide
a _default implementation_ by modifying the `View` trait:

```rust
pub trait View {
    fn resume(&mut self, _context: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn pause(&mut self, _context: &mut Phi) {
    }
    
    fn render(&mut self, context: &mut Phi, elapsed: f64) -> ViewAction;
}
```

Also, akin to `_` meaning _I do not care about this value_, `_context` means
_I may not care about this value_. That is, contrary to the underscore alone,
the value is still bound to the `_context` identifier, but the compiler will
not complain if we do not use it.


## On automatic memory management

When I wrote this code for the first time, I was concerned by whether or not
the memory of the views was actually freed. And it turns out that it is! In
fact, the old view is dropped on the very instant that the assignation is made.
The proof being that, when we add the following code:

```rust
// src/views/mod.rs

// `Drop::drop` is called whenever the object gets out of scope. This is how
// the SDL context knows when to release its low-level dependencies.

impl Drop for ViewA {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropped ViewA");
    }
}

impl Drop for ViewB {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropped ViewB");
    }
}
```

```rust
// src/phi/mod.rs

println!("BEFORE");
current_view = new_view;
println!("AFTER");
```

... I get the following output:

```
FPS: 62
FPS: 62
BEFORE
Dropped ViewA
AFTER
BEFORE
Dropped ViewB
AFTER
FPS: 63
```

In other words, Rust ensures that the current view isn't being borrowed by any
third-party and, knowing this, it simply drops the old view whenever it is
possible. And all of this is handled at compile-time, so it is very fast.


## Conclusion

That was all for today! We have now built the main idea that we will use
throughout the development of our game: views. Plus, if game development is one
of your passions, then views will definitely be a plus, as they are the driving
principle behind frameworks such as [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
(where they are called _screens_).

[Next time](#), we will add a bit more _interactivity_ to our game as we
develop a moving rectangle. Not necessarily _impressive_, but definitely
another step toward a working application.

And until then, keep rusting!
