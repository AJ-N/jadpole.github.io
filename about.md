I am a student at the [CÃ‰GEP de Sherbrooke](http://cegepsherbrooke.qc.ca/),
where I learn about electronics, that is, until I find something more
interesting to do. I'm mostly self-educated, and I study computer science,
physics and mathematics on my spare time. I sometimes write about those
subjects.

More recently, I've been focusing on the Rust programming language,
and I've been trying to teach myself some complex analysis and functions of
several variables.
